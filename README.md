# SharpGrid
A Grid component for Winforms in C#. The component is not entirely mine and originally it was posted at [CodeProject](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5850/Graphical-grid-component). However, The original code was entirely in VB.Net and what I have done is get this sweet little grid control completely rewritten in C#.

#

### My own additions:
- Gradient Backround
- Grid Styling
- Mouse Tracker
- ___Signals!___ (Check the Screenshots)
